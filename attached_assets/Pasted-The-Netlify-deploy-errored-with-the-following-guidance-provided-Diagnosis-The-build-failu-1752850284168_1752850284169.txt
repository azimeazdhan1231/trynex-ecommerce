The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the command `vite build` not being found, resulting in an exit code 127.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `vite` package is included in the `package.json` file or was committed to the repository.
2. Since `vite` is not found, you need to install it as a dependency by running:  
```bash
npm install vite
```

By adding the `vite` dependency and ensuring it is installed, you should be able to resolve the build failure.
