Create a comprehensive premium e-commerce platform for a website named "TryneX" with the following specifications, ensuring all files are generated for download and compatible with Netlify deployment and GitHub hosting, with full integration to Netlify CMS:

- Design: Ultra-modern, dynamic, and premium impression with a clean layout, reflecting July 2025 trends as of 12:04 PM +06, Friday, July 18, 2025, optimized for perfect responsiveness across all screen sizes with precise breakpoints (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px) to ensure proper product card layout and button sizing, preventing issues like auto-opening navbars on smaller screens.
- Files: Generate static files including index.html, styles.css, script.js, products.html, blog.html, products.json, categories.json, and an admin folder (with index.html and config.yml) organized in the root directory. Ensure minified CSS/JS, lazy-loaded images, and clean, well-formed JSON structures (products.json with 50+ items, categories.json with 11 categories) for download. Provide a ZIP file or folder structure ready for upload to Netlify and GitHub.
- Admin Panel: Integrate Netlify CMS for content management, with an admin folder containing index.html and config.yml configured with proper YAML structure for managing products (add, edit, delete), categories, orders, promo codes, banners, offers, order statuses, blog posts, FAQs, reviews, and inventory. Ensure the admin panel is accessible via /admin with role-based access (e.g., Admin, Editor), works with Git-based deployment, and reflects real-time data with functional category tabs, avoiding blank sections.
- Theme: Use a golden (#d4af37), white, and black color scheme applied dynamically with gradients, hover effects, subtle 3D transitions, and advanced animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in, parallax, 3D tilt effects) for a premium feel across all devices.
- Content: Include a complete product catalog with 50+ items across 11 categories, with detailed information for Facebook catalog ads, featuring realistic images and descriptions (use https://via.placeholder.com/300x300?text=Product+Name if real images are unavailable), stored in products.json. Categories are managed via categories.json, both editable via the admin panel:

- Deployment Instructions for Netlify and GitHub:
  - Generate all files in Replit, download as a ZIP or folder, and extract to a local directory.
  - Initialize a Git repository locally: `git init`, add files (`git add .`), commit (`git commit -m "Initial TryneX e-commerce platform"`), and push to a new GitHub repository (e.g., tryneX-website) with `git remote add origin <GitHub-URL>` and `git push -u origin main`.
  - Log into [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com), create a new site from Git, select your GitHub repository, and configure Build settings:
    - Branch to deploy: `main`
    - Base directory: `/` (or blank)
    - Build command: (leave blank, as it‚Äôs a static site)
    - Publish directory: `/`
    - Functions directory: (optional, for email/order logic)
  - Enable **Identity** in **Settings** > **"Access control"** or **"Identity"**, set Registration to **"Invite only"**, and enable **Git Gateway** under **Services** or **"Access control"** > **OAuth**.
  - Invite yourself as Admin via **"Invite users"** with an **Admin** role, accept the invite, and set a password.
  - Deploy the site and access the admin panel at `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/admin` to manage content, ensuring CMS connection works seamlessly.
- Final Checks: Verify all features (cart with WhatsApp, Email, Direct order methods, search, tracking, promo codes, banners, order management, wishlist, reviews, etc.) work seamlessly, reflect in the admin panel, and allow order status updates. Test responsiveness, performance, multi-language support, and error handling (resolved JavaScript errors), then push updated directories to GitHub.
